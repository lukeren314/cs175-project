## Song Genre Classification and Analysis
This project will investigate and compare methods for classifying music genres based on song lyrics. The project will use classification methods of varying degrees of complexity to predict which music genre a song is based on its lyrics, using the ["Multi-Lingual Lyrics for Genre Classification"](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mateibejan/multilingual-lyrics-for-genre-classification) dataset from kaggle containing over 7,900 unique song lyrics, with evaluation using classification accuracy and randomized case studies.
